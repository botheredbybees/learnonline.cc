# Sprint Planning and Development Roadmap

This document outlines the development sprints for the LearnOnline.cc project, including completed sprints and planned future development phases. Each sprint is designed as a complete prompt that can be entered into the Cline interface for implementation.

## Sprint Implementation Workflow

### **Recommended Approach: New Cline Task Per Sprint**

I strongly recommend starting a **new Cline task for each sprint** for these reasons:

1. **The sprint prompts are designed for this**: Each prompt includes comprehensive context requirements and references to previous sprint work
2. **Better focus**: Cline can concentrate entirely on the current sprint without context pollution
3. **Easier debugging**: If issues arise, you can restart the sprint without losing previous work
4. **Cost efficiency**: Smaller context windows are more cost-effective
5. **Documentation value**: Each sprint conversation becomes a valuable reference document

### **Step-by-Step Workflow**

#### **1. Complete Current Sprint**
- Finish all objectives in the current Cline task
- Run comprehensive tests using `./run_tests.sh`
- Verify all deliverables are complete
- Update sprint status in this documentation

#### **2. Create New Task for Next Sprint**
- Use the `new_task` tool in Cline
- Copy the complete sprint prompt from this documentation
- Include the full context requirements and testing specifications
- Reference previous sprint outcomes through the built-in context

#### **3. Sprint Execution**
- Follow the comprehensive sprint prompt objectives
- Implement all testing requirements alongside features
- Maintain consistency with existing codebase patterns
- Update documentation as features are completed

#### **4. Sprint Completion**
- Verify all objectives are met
- Ensure minimum test coverage requirements
- Run performance and security tests as specified
- Update sprint status and prepare for next sprint

### **Context Management**

Each sprint prompt includes:
- **Context Requirements**: References to previous sprint implementations
- **Integration Points**: How to connect with existing systems
- **Testing Framework**: Comprehensive test specifications
- **Quality Standards**: Measurable success criteria

### **Benefits of This Approach**

- **Clean Slate**: Each sprint starts fresh without context pollution
- **Focused Implementation**: Concentrated effort on current objectives
- **Error Recovery**: Easy restart if issues arise
- **Cost Optimization**: Efficient use of context windows
- **Documentation Trail**: Each sprint becomes a reference conversation

# Sprint: Admin Bulk Download System

**Sprint Goal:** Implement comprehensive admin functionality for downloading and populating training package, qualification, skillset, units, performance criteria, elements, and critical aspects tables.

## Overview

This sprint enhances the training units explorer with admin capabilities to order downloads of training data elements from TGA (Training.gov.au). The system provides a structured approach to bulk data import with progress tracking and comprehensive data population.

## User Stories

### Epic: Admin Data Management
As an administrator, I need to be able to download and populate all training data tables so that the system has comprehensive training information for users.

#### Story 1: Training Package Discovery
**As an administrator, I want to view all available training packages from TGA so that I can select which ones to download.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Admin can view paginated list of all available training packages from TGA
- Each package shows: code, title, description, status, and whether it's already in the database
- Admin can filter and search through available packages
- System indicates which packages are already downloaded and processed

#### Story 2: Bulk Training Package Download
**As an administrator, I want to download multiple training packages at once so that I can efficiently populate the system.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Admin can select multiple training packages for bulk download
- System queues downloads as background jobs with progress tracking
- Each download includes package metadata and associated units
- Admin can monitor download progress and view completion status
- Failed downloads are logged with error details

#### Story 3: Unit Discovery and Download
**As an administrator, I want to view and download units with comprehensive data so that the system has complete unit information.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Admin can view all available units from TGA, optionally filtered by training package
- Admin can select multiple units for bulk download
- Unit downloads include elements, performance criteria, critical aspects, and required skills
- System provides comprehensive unit data views including all related information

#### Story 4: Progress Monitoring
**As an administrator, I want to monitor download progress so that I can track system population status.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Real-time progress tracking for all download jobs
- Detailed status information including current item being processed
- Error reporting with specific failure reasons
- Job completion notifications with summary statistics

## Technical Implementation

**Features:**
- Integration with TGA client for package discovery
- Background job creation and management
- Admin-only access controls
- Comprehensive error handling

### Phase 2: Download Manager Service
**File:** `backend/services/download_manager.py`

**Core Functionality:**
- Job queue management with unique job IDs
- Progress tracking and status updates
- Background processing for training packages and units
- Database integration for data storage
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms

**Job Types:**
- `training_packages` - Downloads training package metadata and associated units
- `units` - Downloads comprehensive unit data including XML parsing

### Phase 3: Enhanced Units Router
**File:** `backend/routers/units.py`

**New Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/units/available` - List all available units from TGA
- `POST /api/units/bulk-download` - Queue multiple units for comprehensive download
- `GET /api/units/download-status/{job_id}` - Monitor unit download progress
- `GET /api/units/{unit_id}/elements` - Get unit elements
- `GET /api/units/{unit_id}/performance-criteria` - Get performance criteria
- `GET /api/units/{unit_id}/comprehensive` - Get complete unit data

**Features:**
- Training package filtering for unit discovery
- Comprehensive data population including XML parsing
- Detailed unit information views
- Admin controls for visibility management

## Data Flow

### Training Package Download Flow
1. Admin accesses available training packages endpoint
2. System queries TGA API for all training packages
3. Admin selects packages for download
4. System creates download job and starts background processing
5. Background task downloads each package and associated units
6. System stores package metadata and unit information
7. Admin monitors progress via status endpoint

### Unit Download Flow
1. Admin accesses available units endpoint (optionally filtered by training package)
2. System queries TGA API for units
3. Admin selects units for comprehensive download
4. System creates download job and starts background processing
5. Background task downloads unit details and XML data
6. System parses XML to populate elements, performance criteria, and related tables
7. Admin monitors progress and views comprehensive unit data

## Database Integration

### Tables Populated
- `training_packages` - Training package metadata
- `units` - Unit metadata
- `unit_elements` - Unit elements from XML parsing
- `unit_performance_criteria` - Performance criteria from XML parsing
- `unit_critical_aspects` - Critical aspects (future implementation)
- `unit_required_skills` - Required skills (future implementation)
- `qualifications` - Qualifications (future implementation)
- `skillsets` - Skillsets (future implementation)

### Data Processing
- XML parsing for comprehensive unit data extraction
- Relationship mapping between units and elements
- Performance criteria linking to specific elements
- Status tracking for processing completion

## Security & Access Control

### Admin-Only Features
All bulk download functionality requires admin role:
- Training package discovery and download
- Unit discovery and download
- Progress monitoring
- Visibility management

### Authentication
- JWT bearer token authentication
- Role-based access control
- User permission validation on all admin endpoints

## Error Handling

### Comprehensive Error Management
- TGA API connection failures
- Invalid training package/unit codes
- XML parsing errors
- Database transaction failures
- Background job failures

### Error Reporting
- Detailed error messages in job status
- Failed item tracking with specific error reasons
- Rollback mechanisms for failed database operations
- Logging for debugging and monitoring

## Performance Considerations

### Background Processing
- Non-blocking API endpoints
- Background job queue for long-running operations
- Progress tracking without blocking user interface
- Efficient database operations with batch processing

### Scalability
- Paginated API responses
- Configurable batch sizes
- Memory-efficient XML processing
- Database connection pooling

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 4: Additional Data Types
- Qualifications download and parsing
- Skillsets download and parsing
- Critical aspects extraction from XML
- Required skills extraction from XML

### Phase 5: Advanced Features

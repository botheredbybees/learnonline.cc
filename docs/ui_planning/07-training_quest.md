## **🌆 Training Quest Visual Concept**
The tutorial should **feel like part of the world**, rather than just a standard onboarding flow. Here’s how the **UI could be structured:**

1️⃣ **Opening Scene: City Gates**  
   - Users **arrive at the Guild City**, welcomed by a **mentor NPC**.  
   - **Parallax animation** shifts the environment gently, creating **depth**.  
   - NPC dialogue **appears in an animated scroll**, introducing the guilds.  

2️⃣ **Avatar Selection & Role Assignment**  
   - Users **select their adventurer role** (merchant, artisan, scholar, etc.).  
   - **Hover effects** highlight different options.  
   - Selected avatar **appears beside the dialogue box**, feeling immersive.  

3️⃣ **Guided Exploration of Interactions**  
   - **Click markers** guide users to different mechanics (progress tracking, quest logs).  
   - A **mock side quest** allows them to interact with a **training module** (clickable tree/shop).  
   - Completing the module **triggers a reward animation**.  

4️⃣ **Unlocking the District Map (Registration Prompt)**  
   - NPC **reveals the full city**, but **paths are locked**.  
   - Users receive a **Guild Initiation Badge** and are invited to **register** to unlock full access.

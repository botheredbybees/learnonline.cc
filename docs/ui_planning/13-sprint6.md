# Sprint 6: Visual & Audio Polish

## Overview
This sprint focuses on enhancing the visual and audio experience by integrating AI-generated assets, sound effects, and refining UI animations with Studio Ghibli-inspired aesthetics.

## Technical Implementation

### 1. AI-Generated Assets
- Generate and integrate AI assets for:
  - Character sprites and NPCs
  - Environment assets (buildings, landscapes)
  - UI elements (icons, buttons)
- Store assets in:
  - `frontend/static/img/ai/`
  - `frontend/static/audio/`

### 2. Audio System
- Implement sound effects for:
  - UI interactions (clicks, hovers)
  - Game events (quest completion, level up)
  - Ambient sounds (background music)
- Add smooth transitions between:
  - Scenes
  - UI states
  - Game states
- Store audio files in:
  - `frontend/static/audio/sfx/`
  - `frontend/static/audio/music/`

### 1. UI Refinement
- Apply Ghibli-style animations:
  - Soft, hand-drawn textures
  - Natural motion curves
  - Characterful transitions
- Implement:
  - Particle effects
  - Wind-like motion
  - Watercolor-style overlays
- Store animation presets in:
  - `frontend/static/js/ghibli-animations.js`

## Integration Points
- Connect to existing systems:
  - Asset pipeline (`frontend/gulpfile.js`)
  - Audio manager (`frontend/static/js/audio.js`)
  - Animation system (`frontend/static/js/animations.js`)

## Data Structure Updates
```json
{
  "asset_metadata": {
    "ai_generated": {
      "version": "1.0",
      "sources": ["stable-diffusion", "midjourney"],
      "licenses": ["CC-BY-4.0"]
    }
  }
}
```

## UI Components
1. **Asset Loader**
   - Location: `frontend/static/js/asset-loader.js`
   - Features: Dynamic loading of AI assets

2. **Audio Manager**
   - Location: `frontend/static/js/audio.js`
   - Features: Sound effect triggering, music transitions

3. **Animation System**
   - Location: `frontend/static/js/animations.js`
   - Features: Ghibli-style motion, texture effects

## Testing
1. **Asset Loading**
   - Verify asset loading performance
   - Test memory usage with high-res assets

2. **Audio System**
   - Test sound effect timing
   - Verify volume balancing

3. **UI Animations**
   - Test animation smoothness
   - Verify mobile performance

## Dependencies
- AI asset generation tools
- Audio editing software
- Animation libraries (GSAP, Anime.js)

## Potential Issues
- Large asset sizes
- Audio latency
- Animation performance on mobile

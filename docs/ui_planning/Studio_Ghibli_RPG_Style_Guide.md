# Studio Ghibli-Inspired RPG Style Guide

## 1. Core Visual Identity
Studio Ghibli’s art blends **hand-painted charm, warm colors, and detailed environments** with expressive characters. Your RPG should reflect:
- **Soft painterly textures** (watercolor & ink-like shading)
- **Dreamlike color palettes** (earthy tones with magical highlights)
- **Whimsical character details** (human & creature designs with emotional depth)
- **Environmental richness** (lush landscapes, bustling villages, weather effects)
- **Organic linework** (not hyper-polished—embrace visible brush strokes)

## 2. Color Palette
Use natural, storybook-inspired hues with a touch of fantasy.
- **Primary colors:** Soft pastels, warm sunset hues, ocean blues
- **Accent colors:** Golds, deep reds, vibrant greens for mystical elements
- **Atmospheric shading:** Gentle gradients (avoid harsh contrasts)

## 3. Character Design
Characters should feel expressive and timeless, much like those in Ghibli films.
- **Shapes:** Rounded and organic, avoiding rigid geometry
- **Eyes:** Soft, expressive (not hyper-stylized anime eyes)
- **Clothing:** Flowing fabrics, practical adventure gear
- **Posture & gestures:** Natural movement, conveying emotion subtly
- **Inspiration:** Hayao Miyazaki-style protagonists with curious, adventurous energy

## 4. Environmental & UI Elements
**Backgrounds** should resemble traditional paintings, full of life and movement.
- **Lush greenery** (dense forests, meadows swaying in the breeze)
- **Dusty roads & rustic villages** (Japanese countryside influences)
- **Weather integration** (soft mist, glowing evening light)
- **Animated details** (birds, falling leaves, candle flickers)
- **Signs & icons:** Stylized, slightly worn, hand-painted look

For UI:
- **Menus & buttons:** Inspired by aged parchment, wooden signs, or brush-painted runes
- **Progress bars:** Subtle, resembling ink fading or petals falling
- **Icons:** Handmade-feeling strokes, gentle outlines

## 5. Animation Style
To preserve the RPG immersion, aim for:
- **Natural movements** (wind affecting trees, clothes subtly shifting)
- **Hand-drawn transitions** (fade-ins that mimic brush strokes)
- **Simple but elegant progress animations** (soft level-up glow, ink-like progress bar fills)

## 6. AI Prompt Guidelines
When using AI generators, structure prompts for consistency:

### **1. Define the Core Visual Identity**
This will be the foundation for all assets:
- **Color palette** – Specify exact hex codes (e.g., #E63946 for red accents) so everything matches across different tools.
- **Typography** – Choose fonts that reflect a Japanese video game mood (e.g., bold kanji-style fonts, cyberpunk-inspired text).
- **Texture & shading** – Decide if you want smooth anime-style gradients, pixelated RPG effects, or traditional brush stroke textures.
- **Mood board** – Gather reference images from games with similar aesthetics, like *Okami*, *Persona*, or *Final Fantasy*.

### **2. Define Specific Asset Requirements**
Each type of asset should have a clear description so AI generators maintain a cohesive look:
- **Character Avatars**: "Must have hand-painted textures, high-contrast lighting, and traditional or cyberpunk Japanese elements."
- **UI Elements & Icons**: "Flat, minimalist but with ink-style embellishments—think ancient scroll meets futuristic UI."
- **Backgrounds**: "Soft ink wash aesthetics, blending organic textures with fantasy lighting."

### **3. Structure AI Prompts for Consistency**
AI generators interpret style better when given detailed prompts. Here’s an approach:
- Use a **standard template** for prompts (e.g., *‘A Japanese RPG-style illustration with soft brush textures, rich color depth, cel-shading, and intricate details’*).
- **Include references** (some AI tools allow reference images to guide generation).
- **Specify proportions** (e.g., avatars should be 500x500 px, backgrounds in 1920x1080 px).

### **1. Core Visual Identity**
Studio Ghibli’s art blends **hand-painted charm, warm colors, and detailed environments** with expressive characters. Your RPG should reflect:
- **Soft painterly textures** (watercolor & ink-like shading)
- **Dreamlike color palettes** (earthy tones with magical highlights)
- **Whimsical character details** (human & creature designs with emotional depth)
- **Environmental richness** (lush landscapes, bustling villages, weather effects)
- **Organic linework** (not hyper-polished—embrace visible brush strokes)

### **2. Color Palette**
Use natural, storybook-inspired hues with a touch of fantasy.
- **Primary colors:** Soft pastels, warm sunset hues, ocean blues
- **Accent colors:** Golds, deep reds, vibrant greens for mystical elements
- **Atmospheric shading:** Gentle gradients (avoid harsh contrasts)

### **3. Character Design**
Characters should feel expressive and timeless, much like those in Ghibli films.
- **Shapes:** Rounded and organic, avoiding rigid geometry
- **Eyes:** Soft, expressive (not hyper-stylized anime eyes)
- **Clothing:** Flowing fabrics, practical adventure gear
- **Posture & gestures:** Natural movement, conveying emotion subtly
- **Inspiration:** Hayao Miyazaki-style protagonists with curious, adventurous energy

### **4. Environmental & UI Elements**
**Backgrounds** should resemble traditional paintings, full of life and movement.
- **Lush greenery** (dense forests, meadows swaying in the breeze)
- **Dusty roads & rustic villages** (Japanese countryside influences)
- **Weather integration** (soft mist, glowing evening light)
- **Animated details** (birds, falling leaves, candle flickers)
- **Signs & icons:** Stylized, slightly worn, hand-painted look

For UI:
- **Menus & buttons:** Inspired by aged parchment, wooden signs, or brush-painted runes
- **Progress bars:** Subtle, resembling ink fading or petals falling
- **Icons:** Handmade-feeling strokes, gentle outlines

### **5. Animation Style**
To preserve the RPG immersion, aim for:
- **Natural movements** (wind affecting trees, clothes subtly shifting)
- **Hand-drawn transitions** (fade-ins that mimic brush strokes)
- **Simple but elegant progress animations** (soft level-up glow, ink-like progress bar fills)

### **6. AI Prompt Guidelines**
When using AI generators, structure prompts for consistency:
- **Example Prompt:** *"A high-resolution Studio Ghibli-inspired RPG background. Hand-painted textures, warm fantasy colors, immersive scenery with detailed lighting and organic brush strokes. Soft shading and whimsical elements reminiscent of Spirited Away or Princess Mononoke."*
- **Character Prompt:** *"A Ghibli-style RPG protagonist with expressive eyes, adventure gear, and flowing textures. Balanced realism with magical charm, featuring soft movement and intricate shading."*
- **UI Prompt:** *"Fantasy parchment-styled RPG interface with ink-like buttons and gentle transitions. Warm hues, subtle glow, and hand-drawn aesthetics."*

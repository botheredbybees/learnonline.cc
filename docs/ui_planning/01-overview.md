I am building a website that offers gamified lessons to young adults using vocational education units of competency from the AQTF. Would like to add some graphic elements that would appeal to video game users.  I need the usual banner, background and bullet point images, as well as avatar, awards, progress bar, icons for each of the training packages (IT, plumbing, motor mechanics, ETC) perhaps even images for each unit of competency, although that would be ambitious as there are several hundred. It would be good if they could reflect an RPG mood too.

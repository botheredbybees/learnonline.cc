## **âš¡ 5. UI Enhancements with GSAP & Anime.js**
### **Approach:**
- Implement **smooth transitions** for scrolling, fading effects, and animations.
- Enhance **quest selection mechanics** with visual **quest logs and progress markers**.

### **GSAP Animation for Transitions:**
```javascript
gsap.to("#cityMap", { duration: 1, opacity: 0, onComplete: function() {
    gsap.from("#districtView", { duration: 1, opacity: 0 });
}});
```

### **Anime.js for Certification Progress Effects:**
```javascript
anime({
    targets: '.cert-progress',
    scale: [0.8, 1],
    opacity: [0, 1],
    duration: 800,
    easing: 'easeOutExpo'
});
```

### **ðŸš€ Final Integration Ideas**
- **NPC Mentors provide quest updates dynamically** as users progress.
- **Side quests grant extra rewards** (cosmetic items, special guild seals).
- **Visual upgrades in the city UI** upon completing each qualification.
- **Interactive map markers evolve**, giving **dynamic feedback on progression**.

Would you like **refinements for specific elements**, such as **certification tracking UI or deeper map transitions**? Letâ€™s make this feel **like a truly engaging RPG learning world!**

No, I'd like to explore a training quest introducing the concept of the site and the various interactions and activities. I would like guest users to do this before registering and getting access to the district map

Thatâ€™s a fantastic idea! A **training quest** will orient guest users, giving them an engaging **walkthrough of the platformâ€™s mechanics** before they register and start exploring the full **district map**.
